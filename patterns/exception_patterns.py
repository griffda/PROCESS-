"""Patterns of how to use exceptions in Process.

Exceptions are useful signals to tell you when and where something isn't what it
should be. They are not used to control normal program flow; they are to assist
with debugging by flagging problems closer to the root cause.

Here are some examples of how to use exceptions in Python when dealing with
Python-Fortran interfaced code. These are purely examples to be used as
templates, and are not used by Process itself. This is run by the
test_exception_patterns unit test module.

    This might just result in a failure to deal with a Python-raised exception.
    When some_int == 0, we expect a ZeroDivisionError exception to be thrown
    by Python. It is not handled (caught), so it would cause execution to
    terminate, which may be what is desired. Whilst there would be an exception
    trace, it's not hugely helpful, and more information could be provided.

    This is an exception that Python itself might raise because something error-
    producing has been attempted (such as dividing by zero).

    one_over, but if it throws a ZeroDivisionError, is will catch the exception.

    This is a common pattern, and it provides some discrimination between the
    divide-by-zero and type error cases and any other exceptions. This will
    ultimately catch all exceptions, so execution will plough on regardless.
    This isn't always a good thing; sometimes you want some types of exception
    to not be caught so that execution stops immediately in those cases to
    pinpoint the error.

    Stacking specific error catches like this is good practice.

    This is more useful and interesting: making your own exceptions. They can

    informative and a lot better than separate exceptions and print statements.
    This is good practice.

    If raised, exceptions will halt execution unless they are caught higher up
    in the call stack.
