Added:  
- Functionality to model generic stellarator coils by providing a pre-computed "stella_conf.json" file in the directory of the input file, which consists of reference calculations. Used if `istell=6`
- Stellarator coil forces functionality
- Gradient informed neoclassical transport sanity checks for the final design point
- Updated Stellarator user documentation
- ECRH induced density limits (`icc=91`) and two new iteration variables (f-value and max. achievable ECRH temperature at ignition point)
- New superconductor material jcrit scalings for stellarators (now the same as for tokamaks)
- Updated quench description
- Actual output of VV force density during quench
- Updated Stellarator regression test case (HELIAS-5)
- Gradient lengths information for stellarators
