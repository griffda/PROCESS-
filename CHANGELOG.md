## Features

PLASMOD
 - PLASMOD is a 1D transport model which replaces many of the plasma physics calculations in PROCESS. The previous set up remains available.
 - See reference: E. Fable et al., Fusion Engineering and Design, Volume 130, May 2018, Pages 131-136
 - PLASMOD can be run during every PROCESS iteration by setting ipedestal to 3. It can be run just once, at the end of a PROCESS run by setting ipedestal to 2.

 - Created a new file 'physics_functions.f90' to store code moved from physics.f90 which may be used by PLASMOD and other semi-independent models.
 - This is to prevent circular dependencies.
 - Subroutines include: beamcalc, beamfus, imprad, palph, palph2, prad_ipdg89, psync_albajar_fidone, pthresh, radpwr
 - Functions include: bosch_hale, fsv, p_eped_scaling, t_eped_scaling,

 - New user-defined inputs have been added, which all have the prefix 'plasmod_'. These are specific controls and inputs to PLASMOD.
 - For a complete list, see the vardes file. Where appropriate, previously-existing PROCESS input parameters still apply.
 - Certain constraints and iterations variables cannot be used with PLASMOD - see the User Guide for more information.

2D Scan
 - implemented a basic 2-D scan feature in PROCESS.
 - new inputs `scan_dim`, `isweep_2`, `nsweep_2` and `sweep_2`.
 - Does the scan in a basic grid like manner (i.e. jumps to start of next row from end of previous). Would be nice to upgrade to 'zig-zag'-like approach.

Utilities
 - New script compare_radials.py to plot two radial profiles on the same chart for comparison. Takes input columns of data representing the profiles, with the first column being the x-axis, e.g. radial position.
 - evaluate_uncertainties.py now outputs and additional file to allow analysis of failed PROCESS Runs.
 - New script plot_sankey.py to plot a Sankey diagram of the PROCESS power flow
 - New scripts cost_pie.py and cost_bar.py to analyse cost data.
 - New script popcon.py to plot POPCON plot from MFILE.

Miscellaneous
- TF stress in conduit Tresca criterion can now have regular and CEA adjusted options 
  (adjustment from [Torre et al. 2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390035) 
  paper). (Issue #678)
- [Snipes et al.](2000; http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0741-3335/42/5A/336) H-mode threshold scaling options added (Issue #680)
- Initial version of `.gitlab-ci.yml` created for GitLab CI.
- Added Spherical Tokamak and Stellarator examples to the test suite (Issues #715 and #718)
- Output to MFILE variable names for cost models
- Added [Reinke detachment criterion](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/aa5145/meta) as constraint equation and formula for tesep (Issue #707)

## Minor changes

- Changed upper bound on `coheof` from 1.0e8 to 5.0e8 (Issue #668).
- A number of changes to `plot_proc.py` and outputs in the fortran associated 
  with vertical build. (Merge request !18)
- Update utilities guide for a number of Python utilities
    - `cad_output.py` (Issue #671)
    - `convert_in_dat.py` (Issue #672)
    - `mcnp_output.py` (Issue #674)
    - `output_summary.py` and `output_detailed.py` (Issue #675)
    - `plot_comparison.py` (Merge request !21)
- New Python utility
    - `plot_comparison.py` (Merge request !21)
- File prefixes for input files now works as intended. For example input file called `my_input_IN.DAT`
  will be outputted as `my_input_OUT.DAT` etc.
- `tbrnmn` no longer iteration variable as there is constraint equation 13 and f-value `ftburn` already. `tbrnmn` will act as the constraint limit input value.
- `cdtfleg` no longer an iteration variable.  The outboard leg current density is now calculated for resistive TF coils. (Issue #727)
- `tfacpd` is now calculted for resistive TF coils so is no longer an input.
- Reset test_suite files (Issue #719)
- Added error reporting to function ncore (Issue #735)
- Added input `plasma_res_factor` for adjustment factor for plasma resistivity. Default is 1.0   to preserve old behaviour.
- Added additional scaling factor 'eped_sf' for the EPED pedestal model (pressure and temperature versions).
- Slight change to functionality of utilities/write_new_in_dat.py: This script will no longer create a new IN.DAT from a non-feasible solution. If a scan is run, it will take by default the last feasible solution. If required there is also an option to use the first feasible solution from a scan (Issue #752).
- Made more robust the reading of input files - comments are now denoted only via an asterisk (*), and if a comment is present without an asterisk the reading of the input file will stop (previously it simply ignored constraint equations and iteration variables that could not be read). It is no longer permissible to write an input over multiple lines. Users can now use punctuation in comments as they wish, including full stops and commas.
- Stellarator radial build is output to MFILE (Issue #770)
