# git Usage
## Commit Logs
To see the commit messages you can use the `git log` command. There are various options
described below.

| Command | Description | Example |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| `-(n)`   | show the last `n` commits  | `git log -5` |
| `--since or --after` |  limits the logs to be from date given | `git log --since "21-01-15"` |
| | can use `number.scale` where scale=year, month, week, day and minute | `git log --since 2.weeks` |
| `--until or --before` |  limits the logs to be up to date given | `git log --until "22-01-15"` |
| `--author` | only shows commits from given author | `git log --author "morrisj"` |
| `--grep` | only show commits with a commit message containing the string given | `git log --grep "magnet"`  |
| `--stat` | if you want to see some abbreviated stats for each commit | `git log --stat` |
| `--oneline` | Outputs commit number, date and message to a single line | `git log --oneline` |
| `--graph` | display commits in a ASCI graph/timeline | `git log --graph` |
| `-S` | only show commits adding or removing code matching the string | `git log -S "find_me"` |

- to output the log to a file add `>> file_name.log` to the end of the command

## Changing the code
Major changes

- Create a new branch (e.g. "model_a_development") on the GitLab webpage.
    - or run `git branch new_branch_name` after cloning the repo (next bullet)
- Clone the repository `git clone git@git.ccfe.ac.uk:process/process.git`
- Swap to your branch `git checkout new_branch_name`

Minor changes (e.g. single line changes)

- Clone the repository `git clone git.git.ccfe.ac.uk:process/process.git`

## Committing changes
- Make your changes to the code and at suitable stages commit locally:
    - `git add file_changed_1 file_changed_2`
    - `git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"`
- The commit message should be informative and give useful information for future development.
  - Such as:
  ```
  Made changes to the TF coil magnet model. Updated the allowable stress in the coils
  to be 600MPa. Remove side-wall case. Ran test suite and everything OK.
  ```
  - not
  ```
  Update to magnet model
  ```

- Before pushing back to the repository make sure that your branch is up to date
with any changes that might have been made by other developers, `git pull`
- When you wish to push your branch back to the repository enter `git push`

## Merging
### Develop into your branch
When you have finished making a major change on a new branch, you will need to merge your branch with the develop branch to keep up with the latest changes.

- Make sure you have committed all of your changes to your local branch.
- Update your local repo with `git pull`
- Checkout the development branch `git checkout develop`
- Check remote repo again `git pull`
- Checkout your new branch `git checkout my_branch_name`
- Merge develop into your branch `git merge develop`
- If there are conflicts check the files listed for the following:
```
This line was edited in develop branch
```

- Resolve any conflicts then `git add file_1 file_2` where file_1 and file_2 are
files that had conflicts.
- Commit the changes `git commit`
- Push the branch back to the remote repo `git push`

### Your branch into develop
After having developed your branch, and merged develop into it as detailed in the previous comment, you will need to merge your branch with develop.

- Check your repo is up to date `git pull`
- `git checkout my_branch_name`
- `git checkout develop`
- `git merge my_branch_name`
- Resolve conflicts in similar manner to section above
- `git push`
