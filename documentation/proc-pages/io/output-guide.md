The main output from the code is sent to file `OUT.DAT` in the working directory. It is essential to check that the code reports that it has found a *feasible solution*.

A second file, `MFILE.DAT`, is also produced int he working directory. This file contains most od the same data as `OUT.DAT` but in a different format and has been designed to be "machine-readable" by some of the utility programs described in the utilities documentation, to allow simple post-processing and graphical output to be produced easily.

Radial profiles produced by PLASMOD are stored in output file `RADP.DAT`.
