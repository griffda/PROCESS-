abstract = {A number of models for the critical surface of Nb 3 Sn, and in general A15 superconductors, have been devel-oped in the past years. This paper compares the most common parameterizations using consistent notation. Although the pa-rameterizations appear dissimilar at first sight, they are in reality all based on a fit of the normalized pinning force vs. the reduced field, and have similar scalings for the critical field and critical temperature based on a Unified Scaling Law. In this paper we take the various parameterizations as a basis for a generic scaling proposed for the characterization and production follow-up of the ITER Nb 3 Sn strands. The accuracy of the scaling is estimated using the fitting residuals on various sets of I C (B T) data available in literature. We discuss the results, and give our view of the work towards a unified, practical parameterization.

abstract = {A global signature of the build-up to an intrinsic edge localized mode (ELM) is found in the temporal analytic phase of signals measured in full flux azimuthal loops in the divertor region of JET. Toroidally integrating, full flux loop signals provide a global  measurement proportional to the voltage induced by changes in poloidal magnetic flux; they are electromagnetically induced by the dynamics of spatially integrated current density. We perform direct time-domain analysis of the high time-resolution full flux loop signals VLD2 and VLD3. We analyze plasmas where a steady H-mode is sustained over several seconds during which all the observed ELMs are intrinsic; there is no deliberate intent to pace the ELMing process by external means. ELM occurrence times are determined from the Be II emission at the divertor. We previously [Chapman et al., Phys. Plasmas 21, 062302 (2014); Chapman et al., in 41st EPS Conference on Plasma Physics, Europhysics Conference Abstracts (European Physical Society, 2014), Vol. 38F, ISBN 2-914771-90-8] found that the occurrence times of intrinsic ELMs correlate with specific temporal analytic phases of the VLD2 and VLD3 signals. Here, we investigate how the VLD2 and VLD3 temporal analytic phases vary with time in advance of the ELM occurrence time. We identify a build-up to the ELM in which the VLD2 and VLD3 signals progressively align to the temporal analytic phase at which ELMs preferentially occur, on a ∼2−5 ms timescale. At the same time, the VLD2 and VLD3 signals become temporally phase synchronized with each other, consistent with the emergence of coherent global dynamics in the integrated current density. In a plasma that remains close to a global magnetic equilibrium, this can reflect bulk displacement or motion of the plasma. This build-up signature to an intrinsic ELM can be extracted from a time interval of data that does not extend beyond the ELM occurrence time, so that these full flux loop signals could assist in ELM prediction or mitigation.},

abstract = {A phase relationship is identified between sequential edge localized modes (ELMs) occurrence times in a set of H-mode tokamak plasmas to the voltage measured in full flux azimuthal loops in the divertor region. We focus on plasmas in the Joint European Torus where a steady H-mode is sustained over several seconds, during which ELMs are observed in the Be II emission at the divertor. The ELMs analysed arise from intrinsic ELMing, in that there is no deliberate intent to control the ELMing process by external means. We use ELM timings derived from the Be II signal to perform direct time domain analysis of the full flux loop VLD2 and VLD3 signals, which provide a high cadence global measurement proportional to the voltage induced by changes in poloidal magnetic flux. Specifically, we examine how the time interval between pairs of successive ELMs is linked to the time-evolving phase of the full flux loop signals. Each ELM produces a clear early pulse in the full flux loop signals, whose peak time is used to condition our analysis. The arrival time of the following ELM, relative to this pulse, is found to fall into one of two categories: (i) prompt ELMs, which are directly paced by the initial response seen in the flux loop signals; and (ii) all other ELMs, which occur after the initial response of the full flux loop signals has decayed in amplitude. The times at which ELMs in category (ii) occur, relative to the first ELM of the pair, are clustered at times when the instantaneous phase of the full flux loop signal is close to its value at the time of the first ELM.},

abstract = {The new full-metal ITER-like wall (ILW) at JET was found to have a profound impact on the physics of disruptions. The main difference is a significantly lower fraction (by up to a factor of 5) of energy radiated during the disruption process, yielding higher plasma temperatures after the thermal quench and thus longer current quench times. Thus, a larger fraction of the total energy was conducted to the wall resulting in larger heat loads. Active mitigation by means of massive gas injection became a necessity to avoid beryllium melting already at moderate levels of thermal and magnetic energy (i.e. already at plasma currents of 2 MA). A slower current quench, however, reduced the risk of runaway generation. Another beneficial effect of the ILW is that disruptions have a negligible impact on the formation and performance of the subsequent discharge.

abstract = {A key feature of disruptions during vertical displacement events, discovered in JET in 1996, is the toroidal variation in the measured plasma current Ip, i.e. the plasma current asymmetries, lasting for almost the entire current quench. The unique magnetic diagnostics at JET (full set of poloidal coils and saddle loops recorded either from two toroidally opposite or from four toroidally orthogonal locations) allow for a comprehensive analysis of asymmetrical disruptions with a large scale database. This paper presents an analysis of 4854 disruptions over an 18 year period that includes both the JET carbon (C) wall and the ITER-like (IL) wall (a mixed beryllium/tungsten first wall). In spite of the Ip quench time significantly increasing for the IL-wall compared to C-wall disruptions, the observed toroidal asymmetry time integral (∼ sideways force impulse), did not increase for IL-wall disruptions. The Ip asymmetry has a dominantly n = 1 structure. Its motion in the toroidal direction has a sporadic behaviour, in general. The distributions of the number of rotation periods are found to be very similar for both C- and IL-wall disruptions, and multi-turn rotation was sometimes observed. The Ip asymmetry amplitude has no degradation with rotation frequency for either the C- or IL-wall disruption. Therefore dynamic amplification remains a potentially serious issue for ITER due to possible mechanical resonance of the machine components with the rotating asymmetry.},

abstract = {One of the most important lifetime-limiting effects for a pulsed tokamak reactor, the effect due to pulsing the magnets, is addressed here. Pulsed operation imposes stresses with significant alternating components on all the coils. This paper analyses the effects of fatigue on the coils. (Fatigue of the superconductor itself is not discussed.) Initial work has concentrated on the TF coils. The form of the finite element model is simple to permit parametrisation so that the results can be used in systems studies using codes such as PROCESS. The parameters used so far are geometric scaling factors describing the TF and CS coils only. Once sufficient parameters have been introduced, the resulting equations for stress can give realistic results in a systems code, which allows for the interdependence of all the variables. The magnetic field in the TF coil winding pack due to all the coils is calculated using the Biot-Savart law. This gives the Lorentz force in the winding pack, which is then used for the stress-strain calculation. The alternating stress is calculated by subtracting the stress tensors between two different load cases. In order to meet the lifetime fatigue goal the coil support structure needs to be made stronger than the structure intended for the small number of cycles of a steady-state reactor design, which will add to its radial build. We have quantified these requirements, allowing systems codes to estimate the additional costs. Copyright ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {PROCESS is a reactor systems code – it assesses the engineering and economic viability of a hypothetical fusion power station using simple models of all parts of a reactor system, from the basic plasma physics to the generation of electricity. It has been used for many years, but details of its operation have not been previously published. This paper describes some of its capabilities. PROCESS is usually used in optimisation mode, in which it finds a set of parameters that maximise (or minimise) a figure of merit chosen by the user, while being consistent with the inputs and the specified constraints. Because the user can apply all the physically relevant constraints, while allowing a large number of parameters to vary, it is in principle only necessary to run the code once to produce a self-consistent, physically plausible reactor model. The scope of PROCESS is very wide and goes well beyond reactor physics, including conversion of heat to electricity, buildings, and costs, but this paper describes only the plasma physics and magnetic field calculations. The capabilities of PROCESS in plasma physics are limited, as its main aim is to combine engineering, physics and economics. A model is described which shows the main plasma features of an inductive ITER scenario. Significant differences between the PROCESS results and the published scenario include the bootstrap current and loop voltage. The PROCESS models for these are being revised. Two new models for DEMO have been obtained. The first, DEMO A, is intended to be " conservative " in that it might be possible to build it using the technology of the near future. For example, since current drive technologies are not yet mature, only 12\% of the current is assumed to be due to current drive. Consequently it is a pulsed machine, able to burn for only 1.65 hours at a time. Despite the comparatively large size (major radius is 9 m), the fusion power is only 1.95 GW. The assumed gross thermal efficiency is 33\%, giving just 465 MW net electric power. The second, DEMO B, is intended to be " advanced " in that more optimistic assumptions are made. Comparison of DEMO A and B with a reference ITER scenario shows that current drive and bootstrap fraction need the most extrapolation from the perspective of plasma physics.},

abstract = {Impact and mitigation of disruptions with the ITER-like wall in JET View the table of contents for this issue, or go to the journal homepage for more 2013 Nucl. Fusion 53 093007 Abstract Disruptions are a critical issue for ITER because of the high thermal and magnetic energies that are released on short timescales, which results in extreme forces and heat loads. The choice of material of the plasma-facing components (PFCs) can have significant impact on the loads that arise during a disruption. With the ITER-like wall (ILW) in JET made of beryllium in the main chamber and tungsten in the divertor, the main finding is a low fraction of radiation. This has dropped significantly with the ILW from 50–100\% of the total energy being dissipated during disruptions in CFC wall plasmas, to less than 50\% on average and down to just 10\% for vertical displacement events (VDEs). All other changes in disruption properties and loads are consequences of this low radiation: long current quenches (CQs), high vessel forces caused by halo currents and toroidal current asymmetries as well as severe heat loads. Temperatures close to the melting limit have been locally observed on upper first wall structures during deliberate VDE and even at plasma currents as low as 1.5 MA and thermal energy of about 1.5 MJ only. A high radiation fraction can be regained by massive injection of a mixture of 10\%Ar with 90\%D 2 . This accelerates the CQ thus reducing the halo current and sideways impulse. The temperature of PFCs stays below 400 • C. MGI is now a mandatory tool to mitigate disruptions in closed-loop operation for currents at and above 2.5 MA in JET.

Here we subject 316LN modified base metal and welds to a range of cold work from 0\% to 20\% and a subsequent Nb3Sn reaction heat treatment to evaluate the effects on the tensile properties. With the addition of cold work, the 4 K yield strength increases while tensile elongation decreases in both the base metal and weld.

The dataset was analysed to produce a probability density function (pdf) for the waiting times between edge-localized plasma instabilities (ELMs). The result was entirely unexpected. Instead of a smooth single peaked pdf, a succession of 4–5 sharp maxima and minima uniformly separated by 7–8 ms intervals was found. Here we explore the causes of this newly observed phenomenon, and conclude that it is either due to a naturally occurring self-organized plasma phenomenon or an interaction between the plasma and a real-time control system. If the maxima are a result of 'resonant' frequencies at which ELMs can be triggered more easily, then future ELM control techniques can, and probably will, use them. Either way, these results demand a deeper understanding of the ELM process.},
