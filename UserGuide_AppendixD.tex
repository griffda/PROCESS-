\myappendix{Source Code Documentation}
\label{app:doc}

The development of the \process\ code since its shipment from Oak Ridge
National Laboratory in April 1992 has been fully documented in the
Project Work File~\cite{PWF}. Presented here is a list of Project Work
File Notes as of \today\/ that address various issues related to the
source code.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Documentation of each individual source routine is an ongoing task. A
Work File Note will be produced as each routine is processed, with the
eventual aim of bringing all these together into a single document,
i.e.\ a future edition of this user guide.
\item
Summary of work performed since April 1992 : Note~0160
\item
Code status (routine SCCS version numbers) : Note~0165
\item
SCCS (Source Code Control System) implementation for \process: Note~0003
\item

\item
Future code standard (to be adhered to) : Note~0167
\item

\item

\end{itemize}

Reference~\cite{PWF} was superseded by a new Project Work File,
