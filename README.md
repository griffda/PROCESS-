# PROCESS
PROCESS is the reactor systems code at [CCFE](www.ccfe.ac.uk). More information on PROCESS
can be found on the PROCESS [webpage](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/resources/process/).

PROCESS was originally a Fortran code, but is now Python-wrapped Fortran. In order to use PROCESS, the Fortran must be compiled and a Python-Fortran interface generated for the Python to import. Once built, it can be installed and run as a Python package.

## Getting Started
Please see the [installation guide](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process/installation) and the [usage guide](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process/usage). Once installed, the `examples` directory provides Jupyter notebooks for interactively demonstrating usage of PROCESS, which is a good place to start. The `examples/README.md` provides more help.

## Documentation
To read about how the code works and the modules in it see the [documentation](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process), which is hosted on Gitlab Pages.

## Tracking and Testing
Process uses a mixture of tracking and testing to ensure code reliability. Tests are run on each branch and ensure the output of keys functions are correct. Tracking, on the other hand, shows graphs of a variables changes over time, and what commit caused the change.

Our tracker can be found here: http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process/tracking.html
Documentation on testing can be found here: http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process/development/testing/

## Development
Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md for guidance on how to contribute to PROCESS. Further information is found in the development section of the [documentation](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process).


## Publications
A list of publications using PROCESS is given [here](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process/publications), including two papers outlining the physics and engineering models in PROCESS.
