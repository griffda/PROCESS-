# PROCESS
PROCESS is the reactor systems code at [CCFE](www.ccfe.ac.uk). More information on PROCESS
can be found on the PROCESS [webpage](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/resources/process/).

PROCESS was originally a Fortran code, but is now Python-wrapped Fortran. In order to use PROCESS, the Fortran must be compiled and a Python-Fortran interface generated for the Python to import. Once built, it can be installed and run as a Python package.

## Getting Started
Please see the [installation guide](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process/installation) and the [usage guide](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process/usage). Once installed, the `examples` directory provides Jupyter notebooks for interactively demonstrating usage of PROCESS, which is a good place to start. The `examples/README.md` provides more help.

## Documentation
To read about how the code works and the modules in it see the [documentation](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process), which is hosted on Gitlab Pages.

## Development
Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md for guidance on how to contribute to PROCESS. Further information is found in the development section of the [documentation](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process).

## Testing
PROCESS uses the `pytest` testing framework, and tests are located in the `tests` directory. Usage documentation is coming soon...

## Publications
A list of publications using PROCESS is given [here](http://process.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/process/publications), including two papers outlining the physics and engineering models in PROCESS.
